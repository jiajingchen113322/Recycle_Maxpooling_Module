# Recycling Max Pooling Module for 3D Point Cloud Analysis (CVPR2022)
This is a pytorch implementation of the paper: *A Recycling Max Pooling Module for 3D Point Cloud Analysis*.  
The paper link is: https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Chen_Why_Discard_if_You_Can_Recycle_A_Recycling_Max_Pooling_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf

We are cleaning up the code, and it will be finished and published in one week (before 7/1).

Here is just a draft, for initial learning, you could go to ./model/cls or ./model/seg to compare the original DGCNN and DGCNN with RMP.
