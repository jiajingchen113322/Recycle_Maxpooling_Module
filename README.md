# Recycle_Maxpooling_Module (CVPR2022)
This is an implementation of Recycle Maxpooling Module.

We are cleaning up the code, and it will be finished and published in one week (before 7/1).

Here is just a draft, for initial learning, you could go to ./model/cls or ./model/seg to compare the original DGCNN and DGCNN with RMP.
